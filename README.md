# Zumba-Game-in-Assembly-Langauge-MASM-
This project is a tile-matching Zumba-style arcade game built entirely in MASM615 Assembly, using the Irvine32 library for graphics, keyboard input, and sound. The player controls a stationary cannon that shoots colored balls toward a moving chain, aiming to create matches, chain reactions, and high-score combos before the chain reaches end.

Features

Fully interactive gameplay with smooth ball movement and colorful visual effects

Multiple stages and levels with increasing difficulty, faster ball chains, more colors, obstacles, and power-ups

Player can switch between two loaded balls before shooting

Levels include:

Color Cascade (beginner level)

Rolling Waves, Arc of Fusion

Maze of Momentum, Spiral Surge

Power-ups: Slow-Down Ball, Backwards Ball, Accuracy Ball, Explosion Ball

Sound effects integrated using Irvine procedures

Attractive UI screens: Welcome screen, Game Menu, Instructions, Pause Menu, High Score Screen

High-score file handling: stores player names and top scores in sorted order

Exception handling for invalid inputs

All logic implemented with procedures, using stack-based parameter passing (push/pop)

No high-level constructs (no if/else, no while) — purely Assembly logic

Technical Requirements

Must run on MASM615

Uses Irvine32 library only

Third-level enemies/balls are required to move faster

Clean coding practices required: indentation, comments, meaningful labels

Final submission includes project + gameplay video

Goal

Skillfully aim and match colors to trigger chain reactions, manage gaps, and avoid letting the chain reach the danger zone. Each level introduces new mechanics, colors, and challenges to test reaction time and strategy.
