# Zumba-Game-in-Assembly-Langauge-MASM-
This project is a tile-matching Zumba-style arcade game built entirely in MASM615 Assembly, using the Irvine32 library for graphics, keyboard input, and sound. The player controls a stationary cannon that shoots colored balls toward a moving chain, aiming to create matches, chain reactions, and high-score combos before the chain reaches end.
